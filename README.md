This repository demonstrates a common ActionScript 3 error: attempting to access an image's properties (like width or height) before the image has fully loaded.  The `handleComplete` event listener is triggered when the image loading process is finished. However, directly accessing properties like `loadedImage.width` within this listener might still result in an error if the image hasn't completely loaded internally. This example shows the problem and its solution using an event listener.
